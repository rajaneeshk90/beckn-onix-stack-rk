This use case streamlines the process of selling surplus government property, making it easier for both the government agency to dispose of property it no longer needs and generate revenue, and for buyers to find and purchase a property. This use case involves the process of a government agency identifying property it no longer needs and transferring it to a centralized platform for disposal. The property is listed on the platform and promoted to potential buyers. Interested registered buyers bid on the property and the highest bidder is awarded the property. Finally, the buyer then pays for and takes possession of the property. The use case steps are

1. **Identifying property** Government agency identifies the surplus property it no longer needs
2. **Transferring property** Government agency transfers the property to Surplus Property Management Office (SPMO)
3. **Listing property** Surplus Property Management Office lists the property on the Surplus Property Auctions marketplace
4. **Bidding on property** Registered bidders bid on the property
5. **Awarding property** The highest bidder is awarded the property
6. **Transfer of property** The buyer takes possession of the property
