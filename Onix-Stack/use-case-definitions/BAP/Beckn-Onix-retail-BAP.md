Use your work email address to create an account. We use this to check that you are part of a public sector organisation. We will send an account activation email to this address. You will then be able to set your password.”Step 1: The public sector worker enters their email address to create an account:1. Enter email address2. Validate email address structure3. Confirm ‘Create account’Step 2: The application submits the email address to the relevant Digital Registries BB to verify it belongs to an authorised public sector organisation.Step 3: The application sends an email to the public sector worker with a URL to complete account creation.Step 4: The public sector worker completes account creation:1. Click on link in email2. Create account password3. Confirm |
| Alternative Course(links to other use cases in case there are different ways how to solve the same use case)                      | If the public sector worker does not have an email address recognised by the registry, the registration application needs to provide an alternate mechanism for the worker to request an account.1. System Administrator confirms the domain is valid and adds to the registry.2.
