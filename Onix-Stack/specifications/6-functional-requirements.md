# 6 Functional Requirements

The Beckn-Onix stack does not assume any particular implementation for all internal resource management. A brief description of the functional requirements necessary to orchestrate each key digital functionality is given below, considering the development of a minimum viable product. Detailed design and more elaborate feature lists of these functionalities can be customized by developers to optimally match respective implementation needs. It is also left to the application implementing this Building Block to receive the responses from the Beckn-Onix and present them appropriately and provision for associated user interface interactions.

### **6.1 Catalog Management**&#x20;

* Beckn-Onix stack must allow the creation of a search request with a context and a message. The context must contain the action performed (“search”), the location where the search is limited to (e.g. country, city, area code, etc.), the domain/category of search (e.g. healthcare, services, etc.), the identity of the platform generating the search (e.g. domain, name), the callback URL of the platform generating the search.
