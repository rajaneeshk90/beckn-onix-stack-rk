## 10.3 Future Considerations

The Beckn-Onix Building Block is agnostic to all forms of economic transactions. It provides a generic framework that standardizes any consumer-provider interaction like discovery, ordering, fulfillment and post-fulfillment. Due to its abstracted nature, it may be adapted to any use case. The actual process of discovery, ordering and, fulfillemnt of order though adaptable to the generic framework is kept out of scope for the sake of simplicity. These features will be included later in future versions of the specification as and when diverse procurement use cases from across the globe and across domains are considered, abstracted and adapted to this framework.&#x20;
